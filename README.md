a)
First task is to create a so-called document-term matrix from a number of input documents. Build a dictionary, which is a set of all words that appear across all documents. 
To build the dictionary: (i) process all input documents; (ii) split the input text into tokens using
whitespace and punctuation; and (iii) convert all characters to lower case. Count the occurrence of each token
per document and print the results in a table sorted by token.
